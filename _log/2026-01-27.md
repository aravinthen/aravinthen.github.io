## Summary
* Progress on Sutton and Barto.

## Notes
* It's been very, very useful reading about Monte Carlo methods. At the very least, I now thoroughly understand the difference between off-policy and on-policy models. Seeing the behavioural and target policy represented in terms of importance sampling motivates the difference in a very nice way.

## Remarks
* Still feeling a little off, but I've recovered enough to do some technical reading. 
* Didn't manage to read a paper today: had to work through lunch. It's alright though: given the intensity with which I was pursuing transformers, I feel like spending a bit of time to soak it all in would be a good next step. 
* I may just switch to graph neural network literature just for this week whilst I spend some time implementing the transformer model.
