## Summary
* Started reading [Debugging RL, Without the Agonizing Pain](https://andyljones.com/posts/rl-debugging.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by Andy Jones. Got to the section about loss curves.
* Finished Chapter 2 of Sutton and Barto.

# Notes
1. The blog post by Andy Jones is superbly useful. This is definitely not something I want to breeze past - I'm going to give it a detailed read.
2. Found an interesting bit of terminology in the *Bibliographical and Historical Remarks* section of Chapter 2 of S&B - the exploration/exploitation dilemma is called the identification/control dilemma in control engineering. This puts my GNN reading from yesterday into a different light entirely.

# Remarks
Quiet day today, honestly. I have those sometimes, although I'm not too worried about them: as long as I get *something* done every day I'm happy. :)
