## Summary
* Finished literature review for Week 6.
* Spent some time planning the next steps for my reinforcement learning work.

## Notes
1. I'm glad I spent the last week going through RL software - I now have a relatively good way of thinking about reinforcement learning in terms of software complexity. 
2. I now need to put in the work to get this stuff running. I don't own much in terms of hardware and in general I'm about as cheap as it comes, so buying top-of-the-line computing isn't an option. I'll probably use my reading slot tomorrow to read blog posts and online resources as to where I can use distributing computing resources. I'm aware of `Collab`, but I'm wondering if there's more that I can tap into.

## Remarks
* I'm excited. Looking forward to diving in and being frustrated and finally solving some actual problems. Let the research engineering begin!
