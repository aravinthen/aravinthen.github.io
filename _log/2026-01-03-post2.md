## Summary
* Spent a bit of time looking into the Python multiprocessing library.
* Finished reading the methods section of Silver et. al. 2016.

## Remarks
1. No big write ups today I'm afraid, given that it's the last day of my holiday. 
2. Silver et. al. 2016 is a marvellous paper. Reading it has given me a ton of ideas in how I can extend the projects that I'm doing both in my own time and at work. I get the sense that a lot of the technical challenge lay in the research engineering side of the problem - dealing with the asynchonicity that emerges with the computational requirements of training massive networks. 
3. Even the very slow progress on Sutton and Barto that I've been making throughout the holiday has shown how much of modern reinforcement learning is based around fundamental ideas in the theory. As such, I've decided that for now I'm going to pause my literature study on reinforcement learning: I'm going to focus on deep learning architectures whilst I get up to speed on RL theory and foundations.
