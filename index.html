  <h2>Purpose</h2> 
  <p>
      This is a living research log where I document papers I read, technical concepts I study, and progress on my own research projects.
  </p>
  <p>
      My primary interest is in the design and analysis of autonomous systems. Much of my research effort is based around <b>deep reinforcement learning</b>, optimization and multi-agent systems. I am also slowly but seriously making progress in studying parallel and distributed computation as applied to training deep neural networks. The majority of my content will be dedicated to my research in this area.
  </p> 
  <p> 
      A secondary interest of mine is probabilistic computing, which includes quantum computation. My interest in this field is almost entirely based around its applications to optimisation, which has been a key theme of my work since my graduate studies.
