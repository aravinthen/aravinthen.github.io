## Summary
* More progress on Efficient Python.

## Notes
1. Generator expressions are powerful. Generators in general are really clever for indexing multigeneration data. 
2. I know this because I've accidentally used a generator expressions in the past. :) There was a point doing my PhD where I was using list comprehensions to build cells for a molecular dynamics configuration generator. I thought back then that switching to *tuples* would be more effective, but what I actually did was switch to a generator comprehension!  

## Remarks
* Quiet day today - visiting family and my partner in London. Manage to squeeze in some time to look into some software engineering resources.
