## Summary
* Spent some time reading *Effective Python* by Slatkin.

## Notes
1. I'm on the class section right now, reading about techniques that would have saved me eons had I gone through this book five years ago. 
2. Take `@classmethod` for instance. I've been in many situations where being able to control the initialisation of a class was necessary and the solution I came up with was highly obfuscated and unecessarily complex. I see now that using class method would have been the key here.
3. Take the situation where I'm trying to create DRL code for a large variety of environments. In this situation, if I want to modify attributes for each environment, I can either develop an obfuscated mess of children classes with a unifying parent class, or I could just use class-based polymorphism.

## Remarks
* Necessarily a quiet day today - had to attend a sten-do for a friend's wedding. I did manage to get some good reading done though!
* The content that I'm getting from *Effective Python* is probably some of the most useful work that I'm engaging in. I've used a ton of these new techniques at work and in my own projects so far, which makes me wonder whether I should get through this book first before diving into algorithms study...
