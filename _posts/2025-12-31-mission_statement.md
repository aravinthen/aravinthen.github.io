## Mission statement

Here is a condensed mission statement for where I want this blog to go, as well as the personal development and professional development that will hopefully accompany it. 

In 2026, my goal is to develop a strong grasp on the field of **deep reinforcement learning** as applied to autonomous systems. This entails the following:
* Study and master the underlying theory of deep reinforcement learning.
* Develop a strong familiarity with the technical ecosystem for implementing deep reinforcement learning solutions.
* Commit to keeping on top of the state-of-the-art through literature reviews.
* Actively design and develop my own research directions in deep reinforcement learning.
* Develop a working understanding of parallel and distributed computing as applied to deep reinforcement learning.
* Document the full research process - successes and failures all - on this blog.

## Background
I'm writing this blog post during the earliest hours of my thirtieth birthday. 
If you'd asked my twenty-year-old self where I thought I'd be at this point, I'd almost certainly have said something along the lines of being a professional physicist. I was able to spend much of the last decade pursuing that goal, which is something that I'm increasingly understanding to be a great privilege. Pursuing doctoral work was like an extension of childhood, but the time came when I was forced to grow up: I left the field after an early career fellowship, mostly for financial reasons. 

It was tough at the time, but I do not regret that decision. At all. I have been *incredibly* fortunate in finding the industry role that I have. 

On the other hand, what I miss most of all from my time in research is the structure that having a deep focus on a particular discipline added to my life. My field of choice back then was statistical physics; an immensely rich theoretical framework for the study of complex physics systems. Having this obsession, for lack of a better term, was probably the main conduit to most of my technical development. It also made me genuinely, unabashedly *happy*.

I've been feeling this gap in my life for the last year in which I've been in industry. My role was less about being a practitioner in a particular field and more along the lines of carrying out clean, rigorously tested technical implementation. It was an excellent learning experience and one that certainly made me a stronger programmer, but this was a shift that took me time to adapt to.

The situation quite suddenly changed in November 2025, where I was brought into a project focusing on deep reinforcement learning at work. Here before me was a magnificently rich and powerful discipline, a discipline that combined all that I found alluring in statistical physics with the raw technical force that seems to permeate every state-of-the-art aerospace engineering project. A month and a half of pursuing the field was enough to light up the same craving for intensity that powered the late-night research and the fifteen hour work days willingly undertaken during my PhD. 

So here I sit, in the early hours of my third decade. I have a new research focus and a decade of mishaps and subsequent lessons learned. All that remains is to get on with it. :) 

### Why document it publicly?
I keep a daily journal that I've been writing in daily for the last three years. Of all of the habits that I've cultivated over the last decade, journalling has by far been the most useful. 
The extent of the benefits I've seen will probably make up another post, but the main benefit is that regular documentation clearly demonstrates thought patterns and notions that are themselves instructive. 
In a sense, journalling facilitates meta-learning. I'd like to see how these benefits transfer to a focused technical activity.

I also anticipate that many of my posts will contain errors. Putting out incorrect information on the internet is perhaps the best way of being thoroughly corrected and being corrected is always a good thing.
