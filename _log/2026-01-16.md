## Summary
* Read Effectice Python on the train to London - finished Chapter 2. 
* Spent a little bit of time on compiling the literature review, although this won't be released today.

## Notes
1. Necessarily a quiet day today. My workplace had a quantum computing related workshop that I had to present at, after which I had to dash to London from Bristol.
2. I went to London today because I was intending on forcing my sister and brother-in-law watching the Lord of the Rings. (They liked it!)
