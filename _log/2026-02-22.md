## Summary
* Wrote up literature review for this week.

## Notes
1. Carried out this literature review on the train. This wasn't the ideal place to think through a lot of the issues that I'm having in understanding graph neural networks, but we're getting there. Bit by bit, we're getting there...

## Remarks
* Another quite day. My girlfriend will be going to India in a week and I'll be joining her the next. As such, we're in prep mode - there's a lot to do.
