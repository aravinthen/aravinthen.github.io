## About

My name is Aravinthen Rajkumar. I'm currently employed as an algorithm engineer at MBDA UK, where I work on deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

I was a computational physicist in a previous life. I completed my PhD with the Centre of Doctoral Training in the Modelling of Heterogeneous Systems at the University of Warwick, where I specialised in statistical physics. My graduate work was based around developing advanced Monte Carlo algorithms for self-assembling soft matter systems and then predicting the physics of those systems.
