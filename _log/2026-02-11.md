## Summary
* TBA!

## Notes
* To be transcribed!

## Remarks
* I'm currently travelling for a work event. I was in such a rush to get to the train station that I forgot to pack my iPad, which is where I do most of my reading activity. Oops!
* This is fine! I can still read stuff. However, given that I can't type, its unlikely that my log for today is going to be very populated.
* In fact, I'm going to write my notes on paper and the transcribe them tomorrow, once I'm back from this work trip.
