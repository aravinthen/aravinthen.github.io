      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This is a living research log where I document papers I read, technical concepts I study, and progress on my own research projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary interest is in the design and analysis of autonomous systems. Much of my research effort is based around deep reinforcement learning, optimization and multi-agent systems. A secondary interest of mine is quantum computing, although I don't consider myself a quantum computing researcher.

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Aravinthen Rajkumar. I'm currently working as an algorithm engineer in at a defense company in the UK, where I work on deep reinforcement learning. I'm afraid that this is all I'm at liberty to share about my work. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a computational physicist in a previous life. I completed my PhD with the Centre of Doctoral Training in the Modelling of Heterogeneous Systems at the University of Warwick. My graduate work was based around developing advanced Monte Carlo algorithms for self-assembling soft matter systems.
