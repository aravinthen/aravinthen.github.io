## Summary
* Wrote up literature review for Week 4. 

## Notes
1. This was a light week in terms of reading, given the fact that I had to handle sickness. However, even the light reading was enough to develop the way I think about the autonomous systems problem as a whole.  

## Remarks
* Week 4 already! Time is flying like nothing I've ever seen. I've learned so much about reinforcement learning, but nowhere near as much as I want to know!
