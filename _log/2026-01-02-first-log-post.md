## Summary
* Built a daily logging section on the website for quick-fire updates. 
* Read Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search (Silver 2016).

## Remarks
1. I think that the website architecture is now sufficient. I probably won't be making as many updates to the webpage with the same level of frequency as before: the foundations are here now, so any further changes will be sporadic based on need and whether I have any free time (which I likely won't).
2. Given that Silver 2016 will be a decade old as of this year, I felt that now would be the best time to read this classic. I vividly remember reading about AlphaGo two years into my bachelor's degree, so coming back to this is quite the experience. The paper may have been superceded by more advanced techniques now, but there are some genuinely interesting ideas and working through it is proving to be instructive. Tomorrow, I'll be going through the appendices in depth.
3. I was going through the paper by hand, annotating by pen. This obviously isn't going to work if I want to quickly transfer my notes online. I think I'll be switching to Zotero to do my literature reviews.
