## Summary
* Spent some time reading *Effective Python* today.

## Notes
1. Read some *Effective Python* on the bus today - continuing down the route of generators. I'll be honest, It's quite rare for me to build generators, mostly because I typically haven't worked with massive data systems very much (and when I do, I usually just use an out-of-the-box solution).
2. This is not right. I think that these huge data requirements will be a given on the reinforcement learning path. I'll be writing those - this chaper is going to be useful. 
3. I quite like the way that generators are so *customizable*. These aren't just a means of spitting out state-based output - they're super flexible stream-based systems. 

## Remarks
* Yeah, I'm not going to spend Valentine's day smashing out reinforcement learning software. Just isn't a good look. :)
