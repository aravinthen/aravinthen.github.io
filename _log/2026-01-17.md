## Summary
* Wrote up the literature review for Week 2.

## Notes
1. Again, necessarily a quiet day today. I visit my girlfriend every two weeks - it isn't right to do personal work in company and it certainly isn't right when you're in a long-distance relationship. Regardless of that, I was able to carry out my literature review summary during a quieter hour. :) 
2. Weekly literature reviews are *essential*. Processing the information and then coming back to it to reassess your understanding seems to be about as effective as it gets as a study method.
3. When I was a PhD student, my "method" was to simply read as many papers as I could and hope that something stuck in my mind. It was quite effective at some points: as I'd read a lot of papers, I could typically recall the key words of a random paper given a context and return to it if necessary. I probably missed out on a ton of personal understanding, though. :(
