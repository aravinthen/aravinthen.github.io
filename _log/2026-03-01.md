## Summary
* Wrote my literature review for the week. 

## Notes
1. Spending some time going through the foundations of policy gradient methods makes it quite easy to see how *subtle* the policy gradient technique actually is. There are so many little dynamical considerations that aren't inherent in the definitions...

## Remarks
1. I'm starting get quite comfortable with writing literature reviews on the train. The last three have now been begun and ended before the train actually reached Bristol. Trains are, in general, really nice places to do technical reviews - who'd have thought it?
